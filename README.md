The Semantic Design
===

The purpose of this project is to produce a simple markup template
that can nonetheless be extended to contain most forms of data.

The idea is to then produce multiple different sets of styles (themes)
based on the same markup.

You should find the [source code](index.html) fairly easy to read.
Even if you don't know HTML, it should be understandable.

Every <element> adds semantic meaning to the page.
If you think the source code could be simpler,
please fork or contribute to the project.
