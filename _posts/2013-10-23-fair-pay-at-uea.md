title: "Fair pay at UEA"
---

*Since October 2012, the Young Greens group at the University of East Anglia have been running a Fair Pay Campus Campaign on their campus. Chris Jarvis, Equality and Diversity Co-Ordinator of the UEA Greens writes about how that campaign has been run and offers some lessons they have learnt along the way.*

Over the last year, one of the key activities that the UEA Greens have been involved with has been the running of a Fair Pay Campus Campaign. UEA currently has a pay ratio of over 15:1 and in the recently released Fair Pay League, came in as the 43rd worst University in relation to pay ratios. While not one of the worst offenders by any means, the pay ratio means that our Vice Chancellor earns £225,000 a year while the lowest paid worker earns around £14,000 a year.

So we’ve been busy raising awareness of the issue of pay differentials for the last month, and have engaged in a variety of campaign tactics from publicity stunts to petitioning and from speaker events to passing a motion through our Student Union endorsing the campaign.

This latter tactic has been the most useful tool in our campaign for a number of reasons; it has led to increased and continuous coverage of the campaign in our student newspaper, has demonstrated to the University that the campaign has the backing of a large proportion of the student body, and has allowed us to keep the issues raised in the policy on the agenda of the Student Union. The significance of this is twofold; firstly in that we are able to claim Fair Pay Campus as a Union campaign, and secondly that we have been able to hold on going discussions with the Union on the implementation of the Living Wage for its own employees,  a matter that the UEA Greens got incorporated into the aims for this year’s budget.

Through the use of varied and continued tactics incorporated into our campaign strategy, we have kept Fair Pay Campus as a constantly visible project on our campus, both raising the profile of the Young Greens and keeping pressure on the University.
