title: "Fair pay report launch"
---

The University of Birmingham Greens’ campaign to decrease the pay ratio between the highest and lowest earners in the university launched on October 17th.  Will Duckworth, deputy leader of the party, attended in order to show solidarity and support not only for the campaign, but also to the newly formed Green Party support group within the university.

The author of the report, Rustam Majainah, articulated the main concerns that motivated the report: “Universities have no excuse to pay less than the living wage. Living costs are rising for everyone, students are having to pay £9,000 a year to go through higher education, and university vice-chancellors are paid disproportionately large salaries.”

The aim of the campaign is to get the university to lower the wage of Vice-Chancellor Professor David Eastwood to £140,000 a year from the current figure of £371,924; the money saved by the university could then be redistributed to its lowest paid workers, bringing them up to a living wage.  Professor Eastwood frequently cites the importance of universities and the role they play within society, and so responsible financial conduct is a necessity.  The fact that the pay ratio in higher education is significantly higher than other public sector management positions (e.g. the NHS, the military) should be a great ethical concern to anybody involved with the university.

The other speakers, Head of University of Birmingham Greens James Phillips, Green Party Deputy Will Duckworth, and Guild Vice President of Democracy and Resources Tom Wragg also added their voices, discussing broader issues such as Green Party Policy and the university’s administration.

The Greens Students at Birmingham are now discussing how to move on with their campaign, alongside the Guild of Students’ existing policy on the Living Wage.
