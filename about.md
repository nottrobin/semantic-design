title: "About fair pay campus"
---

The campaign for Fair Pay on Campuses is the movement to reduce pay ratios between the highest and lowest paid workers in the HE sector across England and Wales.  We want to encourage universities to consider a more equality based approach when paying their staff.

In wider society, as well as in the HE sector, increasing inequalities leads to heightening social conflict, a lessening of social ties and bonds, and is detrimental to everyone (wealthy or impoverished). This socio-economic analysis has been captured particularly rigorously in such texts as Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickettâ€™s The Spirit Level. Societies, as well as organisations with smaller inequalities or pay differentials, tend to be more productive and their workers have a greater sense of well-being.

Higher Education as a whole seeing its funding cut by up 10% and academic departments are facing the axe. The current economic climate, more than ever, serves to emphasise that excessive Vice Chancellor pay is unjustifiable; particularly when so many university employees are paid the National Minimum Wage (NMW).

The widening pay differentials in HE over the last decade is unacceptable; especially since many low paid workers are paying for the current financial crisis with their jobs. We believe the heightening inequalities seen on our University campuses are fundamentally bad for the kind of HE community we want to nurture.
