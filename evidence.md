Campus Pay Today
===

University Heads tend to earn [15.35 times the salary of the lowest paid](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=418661), meaning the gap between the lowest paid workers and the senior management on university campuses is the [biggest in the public sector](http://www.nouse.co.uk/2012/01/31/emerging-disparity-between-university-employee-salaries/).

Within the Russell Group universities the [ratio is 19:1](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=415499)&nbsp;and within [FE colleges it is 8.3:1](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/hutton_interim_report.pdf)&nbsp;(Hutton Review p. 28).

 The Times Higher regularly publishes league tables of VC’s pay, and in its latest instalment it [calculated](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=415610)&nbsp;the average salary of heads of Universities as being around £208,593.

More recently, the activist and New Statesman columnist, Laurie Penny, [reported](http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/laurie-penny/2011/04/british-universities-students)&nbsp;an average increase in VC salary of £254,000 per annum for Russell Group Universities.

Government Policy
===

Will Hutton, who headed the review of fair pay in the public sector for the government, [proposes](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/hutton_fairpay_review.pdf)&nbsp;a possible maximum wage ratio between the highest and lowest paid in an institution within the public sector of 20:1.

The Government’s [response](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/indreview_willhutton_responses.htm)&nbsp;to the 20:1 pay ratio proposal was to emphasise that it may ‘hinder recruitment to senior posts by holding down top salaries’ and create ‘perverse incentives for low-paid jobs to be outsourced from the public sector.’ This reply can thus be described as meek at best.

Why we need action
===

- Reports from think tanks like the High Pay Commission show quite convincingly that the market clearly fails to regulate itself when it comes to high pay. We do not want to let the market reign as all this does is create an arms race in top pay- first in the private sector, and then in the public sector.
- Pay differentials within universities have been rising over the last few years. This is unjustifiable at a time of austerity in which many public sector workers are being made redundant and university departments are being savagely cut. Higher Education as a whole has seen its funding cut by up 10 per cent and where individual academic departments are facing the axe.
- Increasing inequalities have been widely found to heighten social conflict, lessen social ties and bonds and are detrimental to everyone. The socio-economic analysis has been captured particularly rigorously in such texts as Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett’s The Spirit Level. On the other hand, more equal (with a smaller pay differential) organisations and businesses are more productive and have a greater sense of social solidarity and well being.
- The minimum wage is not sufficient to fund a decent standard of living; they are poverty wages. A Living Wage provides workers with the necessary income to protect them from impoverishment.

What we are calling for
===

- The Green Party’s policy is to have a maximum wage differential in both the public and private sector of 10:1. We believe this is the standard we should be working towards.
- Greater restraint in top pay can help those at the bottom of the pay hierarchy. For example, reducing the pay of a university head from £250,000 to £140,000 would be enough to raise 59 minimum wage workers to the Living Wage.
- We believe students should be at the forefront of progressive politics when it comes to fair pay, and should champion income equality on campus.
