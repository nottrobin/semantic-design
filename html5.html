    <header>
      <h1>The main title of the document</h1>
      <h2>Subtitle of the document</h2>
    </header>
    
    <p>A short introductory paragraph. Let's try my latin: Lorem ipsum dolor set amet. Oh hell let's face it I don't know what they means, I was just trying to remember how the standard filler text goes, but that's all I can remember. Oh well.</p>
    
    <aside>
      <p>Here's a point that belongs "aside". As in not part of the main text. I'll do my best to make it work.</p>
    </aside>
    
    <h2>Here's a subheading</h2>
    
    <p>And another paragraph, just to put <a href="#dsagfsdf">below my concocted subheading</a> thingy there, to make it look more natural. I put the "h2" subheading there so I could try out the "h2" tag outside the "header" tag.</p>
    <section>
      <header>
        <h1>List of articles</h1>
        <h2>Just a short list of articles</h2>
      </header>
      <p>This is a <a href="#">sub-section</a>, and I think we'll put a list of articles in here:</p>
      
      <article>
        <h1>This is a test article</h1>
        <p> With some test text in it.</p>
      </article>
      
      <article>
        <header>
          <h1>Article 2</h1>
          <h2>This is another test article</h2>
        </header>
        <p>With a sub-heading so I can test that out too.</p>
        <aside>
          <p>Let's not forget that articles, headers and footers are also "section"s.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>There was some more "aside" text so I can test the "aside" feature inside nested sections.</p>
      </article>
    </section>
    
    <p>I think I've tested out about all I can without an HTML5 reference document.</p>
    
    <footer>
      <h1>Here's a footer.</h1>
      <p>With some footer text.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>And a list.</li>
        <li>Of items.</li>
        <li>Should I make lists horizontal?</li>
        <li>I think we'll wait 'till I can see what other HTML5 elements are available.</li>
      </ul>
    </footer>
  </body>
