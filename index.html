        <h1>Simple</h1>

        <p>Above all this design strives to be simple, rather than complete. This makes the project quick to understand and use, and also less prone to complex problems.</p>

        <h1>Accessible</h1>
        
        <p>The design uses a large font-size and standard colours for high accessibility, and the document sections are semantically marked-up with WAI-ARIA roles for screen-readers.</p>

        <h1>Usable</h1>

        <h1>Responsive</h1>

        <h1>Modular</h1>
        
        <p>The style elements are modular, meaning that the markup or styling can be added into different pages and still work.</p>
