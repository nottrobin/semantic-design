title: "Fair Pay Now!"
---

The campaign for Fair Pay on Campuses is the movement to reduce pay ratios between the highest and lowest paid workers in the HE sector across England and Wales. We want to encourage universities to consider a more equality based approach when remunerating their staff.

Higher Education as a whole is seeing its funding cut by up 10% and many academic departments are facing the axe. The current economic climate serves to emphasis, more than ever, that excessive Vice Chancellor pay is unjustifiable; particularly when so many university employees are paid the National Minimum Wage (NMW).

We are asking universities to commit towards the following pledges in order to be accredited the status of a ‘Fair Pay Campus’:

- Will you publish the ratio between your highest and lowest paid worker?
- Will you commit to working towards a 1:10 ratio on campus?
- Will you pledge to pay directly employed workers the living wage?
- Will you ensure your contractors pay their workers the living wage?
- Will you publish the pay of vice chancellors and senior management?
