Semantic HTML
===

The hypertext mark-up language is for defining ("marking-up") sections of a document. There's nothing to stop you from adding as many `<div>`s or `<section>`s as you like, but if you are doing that, you documents are probably more complex than they should be and you're making life harder for yourself in the long-run.

I'm going to define a stricter set of HTML5 for my own use. I will try to write all my own documents to this specification. This will hopefully allow me to swap out style-sheets without having to change the mark-up at all.
